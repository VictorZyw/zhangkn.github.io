### 前言
[frida](https://www.frida.re/)
Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers.
Frida提供了一个名为“ FridaGadget.dylib ” 的动态库，可用于在非越狱设备上测试新开发的应用程序。

Before continuing, it is necessary to have at least a small understanding of the binary structure of an iOS application. 

>* 1、The Mach-O (iOS binary format) binary structure
```
-1) The header contains general information about the binary: byte order (magic number), CPU type, amount of load commands, etc.
-2)The load commands section is like a table of contents of the binary: 
it describes the position of the segments, symbols table, dynamic symbols table etc. 
Each load command includes meta-information, such as type of command, its name, position in a binary, etc. 
-3) The data section contains the application code and the data, such as symbol tables, dynamic symbol tables, etc.
```
